	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Spruce Bot respects the privacy of its users and is committed to protecting their personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and store the data that we receive from our users.</p>

	<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
	<p>We do not store any personal information outside of Discord. The only data that we collect is related to tournament categories, which we use to run the tournament module. We also keep track of the number of tournaments created on the Discord server for the purpose of limiting the number of tournaments that can be created.</p>

	<h2>How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
	<p>The information that we collect is solely used for the purpose of running the tournament module and limiting the number of tournaments that can be created on the Discord server. We do not sell or share any of the information that we collect with third parties.</p>

	<h2>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
	<p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

	<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We reserve the right to modify or update this privacy policy at any time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify our users by posting a notice on our website or by sending an email to the email address associated with their Discord account.</p>
